 * The parametric rendering algorithms are based on similar time-frequency
 * domain acoustic scene analysis as used in e.g. [1-4]. This information is
 * then used to steer beamformers, which are then spatialised in the estimated
 * directions.
 * The residual stream then forgoes decorrelation (although this would be a nice
 * future addition), and employs either a least-squares [5] or MagLS solution
 * [6] for its rendering.
